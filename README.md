# Webpack + ReactJS
Webpack for react projects

Just type `npm i` to install all the stuff you need.
Then you type: `npm start` once `npm i` part is done. This will start server and go into Developer mode 

Once you are done with the project, use `npm build` to get the "production/staging" page.

What the webpack contains
***
* SCSS/Sass Support
* JSX support (now you dont need .jsx)
* JS support (Same as above)
* Image/Favicon and Font support
